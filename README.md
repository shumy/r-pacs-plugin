# r-pacs-plugin

R-PACS is a [Dicoogle](https://github.com/bioinformatics-ua/dicoogle) plugin that has a semi-structured model, composed by the DICOM structure and the extension model to DICOM instances. It was primarily designed for the project of Diabetic Retinopathy Screening, but can be used on any context where a set of annotations are applied to DICOM images.
